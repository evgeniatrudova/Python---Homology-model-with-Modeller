Main problem with homology modeling, is difficulties in finding correct files. 

A strategy, to move the file with homology information into the functional unit of Modeller program, for direct access as ADMINISTRATOR. Which means, that Modeller terminal needs to be opened as Administrator, otherwise no files will be found. 

Resourses 
1. Installed Modeller with functional licence.
2. Installed Studio Visual Code with Python add on. 
3. Move the folder once it contains basic functional files into the C:/ Programs/ ModellerXX:XX/ bin / modelproject


Functional File
1. Folder: modelproject
2. PDB - data downloaded for proteins of intrests, renamed with UNIPROT names. Control that the files are .pdb
3. pdb_95  PIR file from the Modeller, example. 
4. ali.file with the example >P1, TvLDH and FASTA sequence for the proteins with same intro 
>P1,
sequence::::::::0.00 : 0.00
5. The script code sequences. 
After running the code with the terminal, mode files will be added into the folder. 

6. Order or terminal commands 

> cd
version of modeller

> cd bin
orientates you into the bin

> dir
opens the bin file and shows content

> dir modelproject
opens modelproject file with necessary files

> mod10.5 script.py
(control version of modxx.x with name of the scipt file that you want to run)
Controll the file, for any additional files added on, with results of script run by terminal command.
