        file.write("1. Protein structure is uniquely determined by its amino acid sequence.\n")
        file.write("   - Knowing the sequence should theoretically allow prediction of the protein's structure.\n")
        file.write("   - During evolution, protein structures are more conserved than sequences, meaning similar sequences often result in identical or highly similar structures.\n")
        file.write("   - This principle forms the basis of protein modeling techniques.\n\n")

        file.write("2. Homology Modeling:\n")
        file.write("   - Relies on the idea that sequences with >40% similarity are likely to adopt a similar structure.\n")
        file.write("   - One of the three main approaches to protein structure prediction, alongside ab initio modeling and threading (fold recognition).\n\n")

        file.write("3. Ab Initio Modeling:\n")
        file.write("   - Predicts protein structures from scratch using only the amino acid sequence.\n")
        file.write("   - Does not depend on known structures.\n")
        file.write("   - Steps:\n")
        file.write("     * Start with the amino acid sequence.\n")
